In this report we have attempted to understand the degree to which the discriminatory information in various jet substructure observables/taggers overlaps, and how this varies as a function of the parameters of the jets, such as their \pt and radius. This has been done by combining the variables into BDT discriminants, and comparing the background rejection power of this discriminant to the rejection power achieved by the individual variables. The performance of ``all variables'' BDT discriminants has also been investigated, to understand the potential of the ``ultimate'' tagger where ``all'' available information (at least, all of that provided by the variables considered) is used. 

%Ideas for general conclusions:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item It is clear from both the q/g tagging and W tagging studies that the correlation structure between the observables considered is complicated, being both \pt and R dependent.
%\end{itemize}
