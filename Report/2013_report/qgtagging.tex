In this section, we examine the differences between quark- and
gluon-initiated jets in terms of substructure variables. At a fundamental level, the primary difference between quark-  and gluon-initiated jets is the color charge of the initiating parton, typically expressed in terms of the
ratio of the corresponding Casimir factors $C_F/C_A = 4/9$.  
Since the quark has the smaller color charge, it radiates less than a
corresponding
gluon and the naive expectation is that the resulting quark jet will contain
fewer constituents than the corresponding gluon jet. The differing color
structure of the two types of jet will also be realized in the detailed
behavior of their radiation patterns.  
We determine the extent to which the substructure observables capturing these differences are correlated, 
providing some theoretical understanding of these
variables and their performance. 
The motivation for these studies
arises not only from the
desire to ``tag'' a jet as originating from a quark or gluon, but also
to improve our  understanding of the quark and gluon components of the
QCD backgrounds relative to boosted resonances.  While recent studies
have suggested that quark/gluon tagging efficiencies depend highly on
the Monte Carlo generator used \cite{Aad:2014gea,Gallicchio:2012ez}, we are more interested in
understanding the scaling performance with $\pt$ and $R$, and the
correlations between observables, which are expected to be treated
consistently within a single shower scheme.

Other examples of recent analytic studies of the correlations between jet observables
relevant to quark jet versus gluon jet discrimination can be found in
\cite{Larkoski:2013paa, Larkoski:2014tva, Larkoski:2014pca, Procura:2014cba}.

\subsection{Methodology and Observable Classes}

These studies use the $qq$ and $gg$ MC samples described  in Section~\ref{sec:samples}. 
The showered events were clustered with \textsc{FastJet}
3.03 using
the \antikt~algorithm with jet radii of $R = 0.4,\, 0.8,\, 1.2$. In
both signal (quark) and background (gluon) samples, an upper and lower cut on
the leading jet $\pt$ is applied after showering/clustering, to ensure
similar $\pt$ spectra for signal and background in each \pt bin. The bins
in leading jet \pt that are considered are 300-400 GeV, 500-600 GeV,
1.0-1.1 TeV, for the 300-400 GeV, 500-600 GeV,
1.0-1.1 TeV parton \pt slices respectively. 
Various jet grooming approaches are applied to the jets, as described in Section~\ref{sec:substructure}. 
Only leading and subleading jets in each sample are used. The
following observables are studied in this section:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item Number of constituents ($n_{\rm constits}$) in the jet.
\item Pruned Qjet mass volatility, $\Gamma_{\rm Qjet}$.
\item 1-point energy correlation functions, $C_1^{\beta}$ with $\beta=0,\,1,\,2$.
\item 1-subjettiness, $\tau_1^{\beta}$ with $\beta=1,\,2$. The $N$-subjettiness axes are computed using one-pass $k_t$ axis optimization.
\item Ungroomed jet mass,  $m$.
\end{itemize}
%
For simplicity, we hereafter refer to quark-initiated jets (gluon-initiated jets) as quark jets (gluon jets).

We will demonstrate that, in terms of their jet-by-jet correlations and their ability to separate quark jets from gluon jets, 
the above observables fall into five Classes.  The first three observables, $n_{\rm constits}$, 
$\Gamma_{\rm Qjet}$ and $C_1^{\beta=0}$, each constitutes a Class of its own  (Classes I to III) in the sense that they each carry some independent information 
about a jet and, when combined, provide substantially better quark jet and gluon jet separation than any one observable alone.  Of the remaining
observables, $C_1^{\beta=1}$ and $\tau_1^{\beta=1}$ comprise a single class (Class IV) because their distributions are  similar 
for a sample of jets, their jet-by-jet values are highly correlated, and they exhibit very similar power to separate 
quark jets and gluon jets (with very similar dependence on the jet parameters $R$ and $p_T$); this separation power is not improved
when they are combined.  The fifth class (Class V) is composed of $C_1^{\beta=2}$, $\tau_1^{\beta=2}$ and the (ungroomed) jet mass.  Again the 
jet-by-jet correlations are strong (even though the individual observable distributions are somewhat different), the quark versus gluon separation power is very similar
(including the $R$ and $p_T$ dependence), and little is achieved by combining more than one of the Class V observables.  This class structure is
not surprising given that the observables within a class exhibit very similar dependence on the kinematics of the underlying jet constituents.
For example, the members of Class V are constructed from of a sum over pairs of constituents using products of the energy of each member 
of the pair times the angular separation squared for the pair (this is apparent for the ungroomed mass when viewed in terms of a mass-squared with small angular separations).  
By the same argument, the Class IV and Class V observables will be seen to be more similar than any other pair of classes, differing only in the
power ($\beta$) of the dependence on the angular separations, which  produces small but detectable differences.  
We will return to
 a more complete discussion of jet masses in Section~\ref{sec:qg_mass}.

\label{fig:qg_pt500_subst_AKt_R08}
\end{figure*}

In Figure~\ref{fig:qg_pt500_subst_AKt_R08} are shown the quark and
gluon distributions of different substructure observables in the
$\pt=500-600\GeV$ bin for $R=0.8$ jets. These distributions illustrate some of the distinctions between the Classes made above. 
The fundamental difference between quarks and gluons, namely their color charge and consequent amount of radiation in the jet, is clearly indicated in Figure~\ref{fig:qg_pt500_subst_AKt_R08}(a), 
suggesting that simply counting constituents  provides good separation between quark and gluon jets.  In fact, among the observables
considered, one can see by eye that $n_{\rm constits}$ should provide the highest separation
power, \textit{i.e.}, the quark and gluon distributions are most distinct, as was originally noted in \cite{Gallicchio:2011xq,Gallicchio:2012ez}. 
Figure~\ref{fig:qg_pt500_subst_AKt_R08} further suggests
that $C_1^{\beta=0}$ should provide the next best separation, followed by $C_1^{\beta=1}$, as was also
found by the CMS and ATLAS Collaborations \cite{CMS:2013kfa,Aad:2014gea}.   

To more quantitatively study the power of each observable as a
discriminator for quark/gluon tagging, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves are built by scanning each distribution
and plotting the background efficiency (to select gluon jets) vs.~the signal efficiency (to select quark jets). 
Figure~\ref{fig:qg_pt300_single} shows these ROC curves for all of the
substructure variables shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:qg_pt500_subst_AKt_R08} for $R=0.4, 0.8$ and $1.2$ jets (in the $\pt=300$-$400\GeV$
bin). In addition, the ROC curve for a tagger built from a BDT
combination of all the variables (see Section~\ref{sec:multivariate}) is shown.

As suggested earlier, $n_{\rm constits}$ is the best performing variable for all $R$ values, although $C_1^{\beta=0}$ is not far behind, particularly
for $R=0.8$. Most other variables have similar performance, with the main exception of $\Gamma_{\rm Qjet}$, which shows significantly worse
discrimination (this may be due to our choice of
rigidity $\alpha = 0.1$, with other studies suggesting that a smaller value,
such as $\alpha = 0.01$, produces better results \cite{Ellis:2012sn,Ellis:2014eya}). The combination of all variables shows somewhat better discrimination than any individual observable, and
we  give a more detailed discussion in Section~\ref{sec:qg_combi} of the correlations between the observables and their impact on the combined discrimination power.

\label{fig:qg_surface_single}
\end{figure*}
%

We now examine how the performance of the substructure observables varies with $\pt$ and $R$.  To present the results in a ``digestible'' fashion
we  focus on the gluon jet ``rejection'' factor, $1/\epsilon_\text{bkg}$, for a quark signal efficiency, $\epsilon_\text{sig}$, of $50\,\%$.
We can use the values of $1/\epsilon_\text{bkg}$ generated for the 9 kinematic points introduced above ($R = 0.4, 0.8, 1.2$ and 
the 100 GeV $\pt$ bins with lower limits
$p_T = 300\, \text{GeV}$, $500\, \text{GeV}$, $1000\,\text{GeV}$) to generate surface plots.  The surface plots in Figure~\ref{fig:qg_surface_single}
indicate both the level of gluon rejection
and the variation with $\pt$ and $R$ for each of the studied single observable. 
The color shading in these plots is defined so that a value of $1/\epsilon_\text{bkg}\simeq 1$ yields the color ``violet'', while 
$1/\epsilon_\text{bkg}\simeq 20 $ yields the color ``red''.   The ``rainbow'' of colors in between vary linearly with $\log_{10} (1/\epsilon_\text{bkg})$. 

 We organize our results by the classes introduced in the previous subsection:

\noindent{\bf Class I:}~The sole constituent of this class is $n_{\rm constits}$. We see in  Figure~\ref{fig:qg_surface_single}(a) that, as expected,  the numerically largest rejection rates occur
for this observable, with the rejection factor ranging from 6 to 11 and 
varying rather dramatically with $R$.  As $R$ increases the jet collects more constituents from the underlying event, which are the same
for quark and gluon jets, and the separation power decreases.  At large $R$, there is some improvement with increasing $\pt$ due to the 
enhanced QCD radiation, which is different for quarks vs.~gluons.  

\noindent{\bf Class II:}~The variable $\Gamma_{\rm Qjet}$ constitutes this class. Figure~\ref{fig:qg_surface_single}(b) confirms the 
limited efficacy of this single
observable (at least for our parameter choices) with a rejection rate only in the range 2.5 to 2.8.  On the other hand, this 
observable probes a very different
property of jet substructure, \textit{i.e.}, the sensitivity to detailed changes in the grooming procedure, and this difference is suggested
by the distinct $R$ and $\pt$ dependence illustrated in  Figure~\ref{fig:qg_surface_single}(b).  The rejection rate increases with increasing $R$
and decreasing $\pt$, since the distinction between quark and gluon jets for this observable arises from the relative importance of the one
``hard'' gluon emission configuration.  The role of this contribution is enhanced for both decreasing $\pt$ and increasing $R$. 
This general variation with $\pT$ and $R$ is the opposite of what is exhibited in all of the other single variable plots in Figure~\ref{fig:qg_surface_single}.


\noindent{\bf Class III:}~The only member of this class is $C_1^{\beta=0}$. Figure~\ref{fig:qg_surface_single}(c) indicates that this observable  can itself provide a rejection rate in the range
7.8 to 8.6 (intermediate between the two previous observables), and again with distinct $R$ and $\pt$ dependence.  In this case the rejection
rate decreases slowly with increasing $R$, which follows from the fact that $\beta = 0$ implies no weighting of $\Delta R$ in the definition of $C_1^{\beta=0}$, greatly reducing 
the angular dependence.
The rejection rate peaks at intermediate $\pt$ values, an effect visually enhanced by the limited number of 
$\pt$ values included.  


\noindent{\bf Class IV:}~Figures~\ref{fig:qg_surface_single}(d) and (e)  confirm
the very similar properties of the observables $C_1^{\beta=1}$ and $\tau_1^{\beta=1}$ (as already suggested in
Figures~\ref{fig:qg_pt500_subst_AKt_R08}(d) and (e)). They have
 essentially identical rejection rates (4.1 to 5.4) and identical $R$ and $\pt$ dependence (a slow decrease with increasing $R$ and an even
slower increase with increasing $\pt$).  

\noindent{\bf Class V}:~The observables $C_1^{\beta=2}$, $\tau_1^{\beta=2}$, and $m$ have similar rejection rates in the 
range 3.5 to 5.3, as well as very similar $R$ and $\pt$ dependence (a slow decrease with increasing $R$ and an even
slower increase with increasing $\pt$).  

Arguably, drawing a distinction between the Class IV and Class V observables is a fine point, 
but the color shading does suggest some
distinction from the slightly smaller rejection rate in Class V.  Again the strong similarities between the plots within the second and third rows in 
Figure~\ref{fig:qg_surface_single} speaks to the common properties of the observables within the two classes.





In summary, the overall discriminating power between quark and gluon jets tends to
 decrease with increasing $R$, except for the $\Gamma_{\rm Qjet}$ observable, presumably in large part due to the
 contamination from the underlying event. Since the construction of the $\Gamma_{\rm Qjet}$ observable explicitly
involves pruning away the soft, large angle constituents, it is not surprising that it exhibits different $R$ dependence. 
In general the discriminating power increases slowly and monotonically
with $\pt$ (except for the $\Gamma_{\rm Qjet}$ and $C_1^{\beta=0}$ observables). This is presumably due to the overall
increase in radiation from high $\pt$ objects, which accentuates the differences in the quark and gluon color charges and 
 providing some increase in discrimination.  
In the following section, we study the effect of combining multiple observables.

\subsection{Combined Performance and Correlations}\label{sec:qg_combi}
Combining multiple observables in a BDT can give further improvement over cuts on a single variable. Since the improvement from combining correlated observables is expected to be inferior to that from combining uncorrelated observables, studying the performance of multivariable combinations gives insight into the correlations between substructure variables and the physical  
features allowing for quark/gluon discrimination. Based on our discussion of the correlated properties
of observables within a single class, we expect little improvement in the rejection rate when combining observables from the same class,
and substantial improvement when combining observables from different classes.  Our classification of observables for quark/gluon tagging  therefore motivates the study of
particular combinations of variables for use in experimental analyses.
 
 To quantitatively study the improvement obtained from multivariate analyses, we build quark/gluon taggers from
every pair-wise combination of variables studied in the previous section; we also compare the pair-wise performance with the all-variables combination.
  To illustrate the results achieved in this way, we use the same  2D 
surface plots as in Figure~\ref{fig:qg_surface_single}.  
Figure~\ref{fig:qg_surface_pairA} shows pair-wise plots for variables in (a) Class IV and (b) Class V, respectively.  Comparing to the corresponding plots
in Figure~\ref{fig:qg_surface_single}, we see that combining $C_1^{\beta=1}+\tau_{1}^{\beta=1}$ provides a 
small ($\sim10\%$) improvement in the rejection rate  with essentially no change in the $R$ and $\pt$ dependence, while combining $C_1^{\beta=2}+\tau_{1}^{\beta=2}$   
yields a rejection rate that is essentially identical to the single observable rejection rate for all $R$ and $\pt$ values (with a similar conclusion if one
of these observables is replaced with the ungroomed jet mass $m$).  
This  confirms the expectation that the
observables within a single class effectively probe the \textit{same} jet properties.

\end{figure*}
%

Next, we consider  cross-class pairs of observables  in Figure~\ref{fig:qg_surface_pairB}, where, except in the one case noted below,
we use only a single observable from each class for illustrative purposes.
Since $n_{\rm constits}$ is the best performing single variable, the largest rejection
rates are obtained from combining another observable with $n_ {\rm constits}$ (Figures~\ref{fig:qg_surface_pairB}(a) to (e)).  
In general, the rejection rates are larger for the pair-wise case
than for the single variable case.  In particular, the pair $n_{\rm constits}+ C_1^{\beta=1}$ in Figure~\ref{fig:qg_surface_pairB}(b)
yields rejection rates in the range 6.4 to 14.7 with the largest
values at small $R$ and large $\pt$.  As expected, the pair  $n_{\rm constits}+ \tau_1^{\beta=1}$ in Figure~\ref{fig:qg_surface_pairB}(e)
yields very similar rejection rates (6.4 to 15.0), since $C_1^{\beta=1}$ and $\tau_1^{\beta=1}$ are both in Class IV. 
The other pairings with $n_{\rm constits}$ yield smaller 
rejection rates and smaller dynamic ranges.  The pair $n_ {\rm constits}+ C_1^{\beta=0}$ (Figure~\ref{fig:qg_surface_pairB}(d)) exhibits
the smallest range of rates (8.3 to 11.3), suggesting that the differences between these two observables serve to substantially 
reduce the $R$ and $\pt$ dependence for the pair.
The other pairs shown exhibit
similar behavior.  

The $R$ and $\pt$ dependence of the pair-wise combinations is generally similar to the single observable with the most dependence 
on $R$ and $\pt$.  The smallest $R$ and $\pt$ variation always occurs 
when pairing with $C_1^{\beta=0}$.  Changing any of the observables in these pairs with a different observable in the same class (\textit{e.g.},
$C_1^{\beta=2}$ for $\tau_1^{\beta=2}$) produces very similar results.  

Figure~\ref{fig:qg_surface_pairB}(l) shows the
performance of a BDT combination of all the current observables,
with rejection rates in the range 10.5 to 17.1.  The performance is
very similar to that observed for the pair-wise $n_{\rm constits}+
C_1^{\beta=1}$ and $n_{\rm constits}+ \tau_1^{\beta=1}$ combinations,
but with a somewhat narrower range and slightly larger maximum
values. This suggests that almost all of the available information to
discriminate quark and gluon-initiated jets is captured by $n_{\rm
  constits}$ and $C_1^{\beta=1}$ or $\tau_1^{\beta=1}$ variables; this confirms 
  the finding that near-optimal performance can be obtained with a pair of variables
  from \cite{Gallicchio:2011xq}.

Some features are more easily seen with an alternative presentation of
the data. In Figures~\ref{fig:qg_pt1000_comb} and
\ref{fig:qg_akt4_comb} we fix $R$ and $\pt$ and simultaneously show the single- and pair-wise observables performance in a single matrix.  
The numbers in each cell are the same rejection rate for gluons used earlier,
 $1/\epsilon_\text{bkg}$, with $\epsilon_\text{sig}= 50\,\% $ (quarks).  Figure~\ref{fig:qg_pt1000_comb} shows the results for $\pt=1-1.1 \TeV$ and
$R =0.4,0.8,1.2$, while  Figure~\ref{fig:qg_akt4_comb} is for $R = 0.4$ and the 3 $\pt$ bins.  The single observable rejection rates appear on the 
diagonal, and the pairwise results are off the diagonal.  The largest pair-wise rejection rate, as already suggested by Figure~\ref{fig:qg_surface_pairB}(e),
appears at large $\pt$ and small $R$ for the pair $n_ {\rm constits}+ \tau_1^{\beta=1}$ 
(with very similar results for $n_ {\rm constits}+ C_1^{\beta=1}$). 
The correlations indicated by the shading\footnote{The connection between the value of the rejection rate and the shading color in 
Figures~\ref{fig:qg_pt1000_comb} and \ref{fig:qg_akt4_comb} is the same as that in Figures~\ref{fig:qg_surface_single} to \ref{fig:qg_surface_pairB}.}   
should be largely understood as indicating the organization of the observables into the now-familiar
classes.  The all-observable (BDT) result appears as the number at the lower right in each plot.

\label{fig:qg_masses_log}
\end{figure*}

To close the discussion of $q/g$-tagging, we provide some insight into the behavior of the masses of QCD jets initiated by both kinds of partons,
 with and without grooming.  Recall that, in practice, an
identified jet is simply a list of constituents, \textit{i.e.}, final
state particles.  To the extent
that the masses of these individual constituents can be neglected (due to the constituents being relativistic), each constituent has a ``well-
defined'' 4-momentum from its energy and direction.  It follows that the 4-momentum of the jet  is simply the sum of the 4-momenta of the constituents and its square is the jet mass squared.
Simply on dimensional grounds,
we know that jet mass must have an overall linear scaling with $\pt$, with the remaining $\pt$ dependence arising predominantly from the running of the coupling,
$\alpha_s(\pt)$.  The $R$ dependence is also crudely linear as the jet mass scales approximately with the largest angular opening between any 2 constituents,
which is set by $R$.

To demonstrate this universal behavior for jet mass, we first note that if we consider the mass distributions for many kinematic points (various values of $R$ and $\pt$),
we observe considerable variation in behaviour. This variation, however, can largely be removed by plotting versus the scaled variable $m/p_T/R$.  The mass distributions for quark and gluon jets versus $m/p_T/R$ for all of our kinematic points 
are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:qg_masses_log}, where
we use a logarithmic scale on the y-axis to clearly exhibit the behavior of these distributions over a large dynamic range.  We observe that the distributions
for the different kinematic points do approximately scale as expected, \textit{i.e.}, the simple arguments above capture most of the variation with $R$ and $\pt$.
We will consider shortly an explanation of the residual non-scaling. A
more rigorous quantitative understanding of jet mass distributions
requires all-orders calculations in QCD, which have been performed for
groomed and ungroomed jet mass spectra at high logarithmic accuracy, both in the context of direct QCD resummation~\cite{Li:2012bw,Dasgupta:2012hg,Dasgupta:2013ihk,Dasgupta:2013via} and Soft Collinear Effective Theory~\cite{Chien:2012ur,Jouttenus:2013hs}.

\end{figure*}

Several features of Figure~\ref{fig:qg_masses_log} can be easily understood.  The distributions all cut off rapidly for $m/p_T/R > 0.5$, which is understood as
the precise limit (maximum mass) for a jet composed of just 2 constituents.  As expected from the soft and collinear singularities in QCD, the mass distribution peaks 
at small mass values.  The actual peak is ``pushed'' away from the origin by the so-called Sudakov form factor.  Summing the corresponding logarithmic structure 
(singular in both $\pt$ and angle) to all orders in perturbation theory yields a distribution that is highly damped  as the mass vanishes.  In words, there is precisely 
\textit{zero} probability that a color parton emits \textit{no} radiation (and the resulting jet has zero mass). Above the Sudakov-suppressed part of phase space, there are two 
structures in the distribution:~the ``shoulder'' and the ``peak''.
 The large mass shoulder ($0.3 < m/p_T/R < 0.5$) is driven largely by the presence of a single large angle, energetic
emission in the underlying QCD shower, \textit{i.e.}, this regime is quite well described by low-order perturbation theory\footnote{The shoulder label will become more clear when examining groomed jet mass distributions.} 
In contrast, we can think of the peak region as corresponding to multiple soft emissions.  This simple, necessarily approximate picture 
provides an understanding of the bulk of the
differences between the quark and gluon jet mass distributions.  Since the probability of the single large angle, energetic emission is proportional to the color charge,
the gluon distribution should be enhanced in this region by a factor of about $C_A/C_F = 9/4$, consistent with what is observed in Figure~\ref{fig:qg_masses_log}.
Similarly the exponent in the Sudakov damping factor for the gluon jet mass distribution  is enhanced by the same factor, 
leading to a peak ``pushed'' further from the origin.  Therefore, compared to a quark jet, the gluon jet mass 
distribution exhibits a larger average jet mass, with a larger relative contribution arising from the perturbative shoulder region and a small mass peak that is further
from the origin.  

 
Together with  the fact that the number of constituents in the jet is also larger (on average) for the gluon jet simply because a gluon will radiate more than a quark, these features explain much of what we observed earlier in terms of the effectiveness of the various observables to separate quark jets from gluons jets. They also give us insight into the difference in the distributions for the observable 
$\Gamma_{\rm Qjet}$. Since the shoulder is dominated by a single large angle, \textit{hard} emission, it is minimally impacted by pruning,
which is designed to remove the large angle, \textit{soft} constituents (as shown in more detail below). Thus, jets in the shoulder exhibit small volatility and they are a larger
component in the gluon jet distribution.  Hence gluon jets, on average, have smaller values of  $\Gamma_{\rm Qjet}$ than quark jets as in 
Figure~\ref{fig:qg_pt500_subst_AKt_R08}(b).  Further, this feature of gluon jets is distinct from the fact that there are more constituents, explaining why
$\Gamma_{\rm Qjet}$ and $n_ {\rm constits}$ supply largely independent information for distinguishing quark and gluon jets. 

To illustrate some of these points in more detail, Figure~\ref{fig:qg_prmasses_log} exhibits the same jet mass distributions  
\textit{after pruning}~\cite{Ellis:2009me,Ellis:2009su}.  Removing the large angle,  soft constituents
moves the peak in both of the distributions from  $m/p_T/R \sim 0.1 - 0.2$ to the region around $m/p_T/R \sim 0.05$.  This explains why pruning works to reduce the
QCD background when looking for a signal in a specific jet mass bin.  The shoulder feature at higher mass is much more apparent after pruning, as is the larger shoulder for
the gluon jets.  A quantitative (all-orders) understanding of groomed mass distributions is also possible. For instance, resummation of the pruned mass distribution was achieved in~\cite{Dasgupta:2013ihk,Dasgupta:2013via}. Figure~\ref{fig:qg_prmasses_log} serves to confirm the physical understanding of the relative behavior of $\Gamma_{\rm Qjet}$ for quark and gluon jets.

Our final topic in this section is the residual $R$ and $\pt$ dependence exhibited in Figures~\ref{fig:qg_masses_log} and \ref{fig:qg_prmasses_log}, which
indicates a deviation from the naive linear scaling that has been removed by using the scaled variable $m/p_T/R$.  
A helpful, intuitively simple, if admittedly imprecise, model of a jet is to separate the constituents of the jet into ``hard'' (with $\pt$'s that are of order the jet 
$\pt$) versus ``soft'' (with $\pt$'s small and fixed compared to the jet $\pt$), and ``large'' angle (with an angular separation from the jet direction of order $R$)
versus ``small'' angle (with an angular separation from the jet direction smaller than and not scaling with $R$) components. 
As described above the Sudakov damping factor excludes constituents that are very soft or very small angle (or both).
In this simple picture 
perturbative large angle, hard constituents appear rarely, but, as described above, they characterize the large mass jets that appear in the
``shoulder'' of the jet mass distribution where the mass scales approximately linearly with the jet $\pt$ and with $R$.  
The hard, small angle constituents are somewhat more numerous
and contribute to a jet mass that does not scale with $R$.  The soft constituents are much more numerous (becoming more numerous
with increasing jet $\pt$) and contribute to a jet mass that scales like
$\sqrt{p_{T,\text{jet}}}$.  The small angle, soft constituents contribute to a jet mass that does not scale with $R$, while the large angle, soft
constituents do contribute to a jet mass that scales like $R$  and grow in number approximately linearly in $R$ (\textit{i.e.}, with the area
of the annulus at the outer edge of the jet).  This simple picture allows at least a qualitative explanation of the behavior observed in 
Figures~\ref{fig:qg_masses_log} and \ref{fig:qg_prmasses_log}.
    
As already suggested, the residual $\pt$ dependence can be understood as arising primarily from the slow decrease of the strong coupling $\alpha_s(\pt)$ as $\pt$ increases.  This leads to a corresponding decrease in the (largely perturbative) shoulder regime for both distributions
at higher $\pt$, \textit{i.e.}, a decrease in the number of hard, large angle constituents.  
At the same time, and for the same reason, the Sudakov damping is less strong with increasing $\pt$ and the peak moves in towards the origin.
While the number of soft constituents increases with increasing jet $\pt$, their contributions to the scaled jet mass distribution shift to smaller
values of $m/\pt$ (decreasing approximately like $1/\sqrt{\pt}$).
Thus the overall impact of increasing $\pt$ for both distributions is a (gradual) shift to smaller values of $m/p_T/R$.  This is just what is observed in 
Figures~\ref{fig:qg_masses_log} and \ref{fig:qg_prmasses_log}, although the numerical size of the effect is reduced in the pruned case.

The residual $R$ dependence is somewhat more complicated.  
The perturbative large angle, hard constituent contribution
largely scales in the variable $m/p_T/R$, which is why we see little residual $R$ dependence in either figure at higher masses ($m/p_T/R > 0.4$).  
The contribution of the small angle constituents (hard and soft) contribute at fixed $m$ and thus shift to the left versus the scaled variable as $R$ increases.  
This presumably explains the small shifts in this direction at small mass observed in both figures.
The large angle, soft constituents contribute to mass values that scale like $R$, and, as noted above, tend to increase in number as $R$ increases 
(\textit{i.e.}, as the area of the jet grows).  Such contributions  yield a scaled jet mass
distribution that shifts to the right with increasing $R$  and presumably explain the behavior at small $\pt$ in Figure~\ref{fig:qg_masses_log}.  Since pruning
largely removes this contribution, we observe no such behavior in Figure~\ref{fig:qg_prmasses_log}. 

 \subsection{Conclusions}\label{sec:qg_concl}

In Section~\ref{sec:qgtagging} we have seen that a variety of jet observables
 provide information about the jet that can be employed  to effectively separate quark-initiated from gluon-initiated jets.  Further,
when used in combination, these observables can provide superior separation. Since the improvement depends on the correlation between observables,
we use the multivariable performance to separate the observables into different classes, with each class containing highly correlated observables.  
We saw that the best performing single observable is simply the number of
constituents in the jet, $n_ {\rm constits}$,  while the largest
further improvement comes from combining with $C_1^{\beta =1}$ (or
$\tau_1^{\beta=1}$). The performance of this combined tagger is
strongly dependent on \pt and $R$, with the best performance being
observed for smaller $R$ and higher \pt. The smallest
$R$ and $\pt$ dependence arises from combining $n_ {\rm constits}$ with $C_1^{\beta =
  0}$. Some of the commonly used observables for $q/g$ tagging are highly correlated
and do not provide extra information when used together. 
We have found that adding further variables to the $n_ {\rm constits}$
+ $C_1^{\beta =1}$  or $n_ {\rm constits}$
+ $\tau_1^{\beta =1}$ BDT combination
results in only a small improvement in performance, suggesting that almost all of the available information to
discriminate quark and gluon-initiated jets is captured by $n_{\rm
  constits}$ and $C_1^{\beta=1}$ (or $\tau_1^{\beta=1}$)
variables. In addition to demonstrating these correlations, we have provided a discussion of the 
physics behind the structure of the correlation.  Using the jet mass as an example, we have given arguments to explicitly explain the differences between jet observables 
initiated by each type of parton. 


Finally, we remind the reader that the numerical results were derived for a particular color
configuration ($qq$ and $gg$ events), in a particular implementation of the parton shower and hadronization. Color
connections in more complex event configurations, or different Monte Carlo programs,
may well exhibit somewhat different efficiencies and rejection factors. The value of our results
is that they indicate a subset of variables expected to be rich in information about
the partonic origin of final-state jets. These variables can  be expected to act as valuable
discriminants in searches for new physics, and could also be used to define 
model-independent final-state measurements which would nevertheless be sensitive to the
short-distance physics of quark and gluon production.
