In this section we examine the differences between quark and gluon initiated jets in terms of the substructure variables, and to what extent these variables are correlated. Along the way, we attempt to provide some theoretical understanding of these observations. The motivation for these studies comes not only from the desire to ``tag'' a jet as being quark or gluon initiated, but also from the point of view of understanding the quark and gluon components of the QCD background to boosted boson and boosted top tagging.  

\subsection{Methodology}

%{\it Start adding outline/discussion of theoretical understanding}
These studies use the $qq$ and $gg$ samples, described previously in Section~\ref{sec:samples}.

Jets are reconstructed using the \antikt algorithm, and have various
jet grooming approaches applied, as described in Section~\ref{sec:jetalgs}. 
Radius parameters of 0.4, 0.8 and 1.2 are used for these studies. 
Only leading and subleading jets well above the generation cut are used
in the study. Samples generated in different $\pt$ slices are used to study 
different $\pt$ ranges as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:samples}. {\bf [edit: maybe summarize in a table]}. 

Go on to explain how we produce the ROC curves, how the BDT training
is done etc.

Figure~\ref{fig:qg_pt500_basics_AKt_R08} shows a comparison of the quark and gluon samples
$\pt$ and $\eta$ distributions for the sample used to study jets of $\pt=500-600$~GeV.

\end{center}
\end{figure*}
The differences in the $\pt$ distributions can be attributed to different out-of-cone radiation
patterns for quark and gluons, while the different $\eta$ distributions are related to the different
parton density functions involved in $qq$ and $gg$ production. The qualitative features of the 
$\eta$ distributions do not change as the $R$ parameter is changed. As the $\pt$ increases, 
the $\eta$ distributions peak more strongly near zero, as expected. Differences in the $\pt$ distributions 
between the leading and sub-leading (and quark and gluon-induced) jets become smaller as the 
$R$ parameter is increased, as expected from the physics behind these differences, outlined above. 

\subsection{Single Variable Discrimination}

Figure~\ref{fig:qg_pt500_mass_AKt_R08} shows the mass of jets in the quark and gluon samples when using
different groomers, and Figure~\ref{fig:qg_pt500_subst_AKt_R08} shows similar comparisons for different 
substructure variables. Jets built with the anti-\kT algorithm with R=0.8 and with $\pt=500-650 \GeV$ are used.

\label{fig:qg_pt500_mass_AKt_R08}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}
Qualitatively, the application of grooming shifts the mass distributions towards
lower values as expected. No clear gain in discrimination can be seen, and for
certain grooming parameters, such as the use of soft drop with $\beta=-1$ a clear
loss in discrimination power is observed. Few variations are observed as the 
radius parameter of the jet reconstruction is increased in the two highest $\pt$ bins. 
However, for the $300-400\GeV$ bin, the use of small-R jets produces a shift in the
mass distributions towards lower values, so that large-R jet masses are more stable
with $\pt$ and small-R jet masses are smaller at low-$\pt$ as expected from the spatial
constraints imposed by the R parameter. These statements are explored more 
quantitatively later in this section.

Among the different substructure variables explored, $n_{\rm constituents}$ provides the highest separation
power, followed by $C_1^{\beta=0}$ and $C_1^{\beta=1}$ as was also found by the CMS and ATLAS Collaborations 
{\bf [add citations]}. The evolution of some of these distributions with $\pt$ and R is a bit more interesting than what
was discussed for the jet mass. In particular, changing the R parameter at high $\pt$ changes significantly the $C_a^{\beta}$
for $\beta>0$ and the $n_{\rm constits}$ distributions, while leaving all other distributions qualitatively unchanged. 
This is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:Rdep_qg_C_pt1000} for $\beta=0$ and $\beta=1$ using $a=1$ in both cases for
jets with $\pt=1-1.2\TeV$.

The shift towards lower values with changing R is evident for the $C_1^{\beta=1}$ distributions, while the stability
of $C_1^{\beta=0}$ can also be observed. These features are present in all $\pt$ bins studied, but are even more
pronounced for lower $\pt$ bins. The shape of the Q-jet volatility distribution shows some non-trivial shape that
deserves some explanation. Two peaks are observed, one at low volatility values and one at mid-volatility. These
peaks are generated by two somewhat distinct populations. The high volatility peak arises from jets that get their
mass primarily from soft (and sometimes wide-angle) emissions. The removal of some of the constituents when
building Q-jets thus changes the mass significantly, increasing the volatility. The lower volatility peak corresponds
to jets for which mass is generated by a hard emission. 


 lowest peak corresponds to jets for which mass is generated by soft emissions primarily. 
The 

In order to be more quantitative about these results and the power of each variable as a
discriminator for quark/gluon tagging, ROC curves are built by scanning each distribution
and plotting the background efficiency (efficiency to select gluon jets) vs the efficiency for
quark selection. 
Figure~\ref{fig:qg_pt300_single} shows these ROC curves for all of the variables shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:qg_pt500_subst_AKt_R08} and the ungroomed mass, representing the 
best performing mass variable for jets of $\pt=300-400\GeV$. In addition, the ROC curve for 
the tagger built from a BDT combining all the variables. The details of how the BDT is constructed 
are explained in Section~\ref{sec:qg_combi}.

Clearly, $n_{\rm constits}$ is the best performing variable for all Rs, even though $C_1^{\beta=0}$ is close, particularly
for R=0.8. Most other variables have similar performance, except the Q-jet volatility, which shows significantly worse
discrimination. The combination of all variables shows somewhat better discrimination. The overall discriminating 
power decreases with increasing R, and the features discussed for this $\pt$ bin also apply to the higher
$\pt$ bins. This statement is quantified in later sections.

\subsection{QJets Volatility and $\ptd$ ($\C{1}{\beta=0}$)}

Simple explanation of correlation, or why does combining volatility and $\ptd$ improve quark versus gluon discrimination.  $\ptd$ ($\C{1}{\beta=0}$) takes small (large) values for a jet with near-democratic energy sharing between particles and large (small) values when the energy of the jet is contained in a few particles.  Because we expect gluons to radiate more particles, we expect that $\ptd_g<\ptd_q$ (or ${\C{1}{\beta=0}}_g>{\C{1}{\beta=0}}_q$).  Now, we expect the volatility of gluon jets to be in general smaller than that of quark jets because there is a greater probability (by a factor of about $C_A/C_F=9/4$) that there was a relatively hard emission in a jet that is not groomed away.  By measuring both volatility and $\ptd$, we are sensitive to both regions of phase space: where a relatively hard emission dominates the mass of the jet as well as the region where many soft emissions set the jet mass.

{\it The following is Steve's discussion of volatility difference between quarks and gluons:}

   Here is the (qualitative) thinking:  typical QCD jet mass distributions look as illustrated on slide 17, although you should really be thinking in terms of plot versus $m/p_T$, since $p_T$ is what sets the scale in the plot.  Qualitatively there is a (very) large peak for $m/p_T \lesssim 0.1$ and you should think of these jets as having masses that arise from multiple soft emissions, some of which are at substantial angles.  It is these components of the jet that are operated on by pruning (reducing the mass dramatically) and that yield the large volatility tail for QCD jets.  For larger $m/p_T$ values there is typically a “shoulder” (my description is clearest on a semi-log plot) that runs out to about $m/pT \sim 0.4 – 0.5$ (where the distribution decreases rapidly).  These are the QCD jets (a small fraction of the total in a given $p_T$ bin) that contain a “hard”, relatively large angle emission, which supplies the bulk of the jet mass.  Such jets are effected only slightly by pruning and should exhibit much smaller volatility than the jets in the (smaller mass) peak region.
 
  With that picture in mind and recalling that the size of the “shoulder” is given by low order perturbation theory (the probability of the one hard emission), we expect that the “shoulder” will be higher for gluons than for quarks (essentially by the usual $C_A/C_F$ color charge factor), as suggested by the lower right plot on slide 17.  Since the shoulder presumably plays a more important role for gluons (since it is larger), one would expect that the volatility distribution for gluons is narrower than quarks, as suggested in the upper left plot on slide 17.  Am I making sense?
 
  On the other hand, the volatility distribution plot indicates that the Q vs G distributions for your cuts are not really very different, which is presumably why it is not a very good discriminant by itself.  But I expect this to depend it detail on where we are operating on the m/pT distributions.  This leads to my request above.  Your $p_T$ bin is pretty broad and I don’t expect the q and g samples to have the same shape within the bin.  Of course, this may not be an issue, but I would like to check.
