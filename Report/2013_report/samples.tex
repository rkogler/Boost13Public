\subsection{Quark/gluon and $W$ tagging}

Samples were generated at $\sqrt{s} = 8\TeV$ for QCD dijets, and for $W^+W^-$
pairs produced in the decay of a (pseudo) scalar resonance and
decaying hadronically. The QCD events
were split into subsamples of $gg$ and $q\bar{q}$ events, allowing for tests of
discrimination of hadronic $W$ bosons, quarks, and gluons.

Individual $gg$ and $q\bar{q}$ samples were produced at leading order (LO)
using \textsc{MadGraph5}, while $W^+W^-$ samples were generated using
the \textsc{JHU Generator} to allow for separation of longitudinal and
transverse polarizations. Both were generated using \textsc{CTEQ6L1}
PDFs\refneeded. The samples were produced in exclusive $p_T$ bins
of width 100 {\GeV}, with the slicing parameter
chosen to be the $p_T$ of any final state parton or $W$ at LO. At the
parton-level the \pt bins investigated were 300-400 GeV, 500-600 GeV
and 1.0-1.1 TeV. Since
no matching was performed, a cut on any parton was equivalent. The samples were
then all showered through \textsc{Pythia8} (version 8.176)\refneeded using the default tune 4C\refneeded.

\subsection{Top tagging} \label{sec:top-samples}
Samples were generated at $\sqrt{s}=14\TeV$. Standard Model dijet and top pair
samples were produced with \textsc{Sherpa} 2.0.0\refneeded, with matrix elements of up
to two extra partons matched to the shower. The top samples included only
hadronic decays and  were generated in exclusive $\pt$ bins of width 100 \GeV,
taking as slicing parameter the maximum of the top/anti-top $\pt$. The QCD
samples were generated with a cut on the leading parton-level jet $\pt$, where
parton-level jets are clustered with the anti-$k_t$ algorithm and jet radii of
$R= 0.4,\,0.8,\,1.2$. The matching scale is selected to be $Q_{\rm cut}=40, 60, 80 \GeV$ for
the $p_{T\,\text{min}}=600, 1000$, and $1500 \GeV$ bins, respectively.
