In the below sections the Monte Carlo samples used in the q/g tagging,
W tagging and Top tagging sections of this report are described. Note
that in all cases the samples used contain no additional proton-proton
interactions beyond the hard scatter (no pile-up), and there is no
attempt to emulate the degradation in angular and \pt resolution that
would result when reconstructing the jets inside a real detector.


\subsection{Quark/gluon and $W$ tagging}

Samples were generated at $\sqrt{s} = 8\TeV$ for QCD dijets, and for $W^+W^-$
pairs produced in the decay of a (pseudo) scalar resonance and
decaying hadronically. The QCD events
were split into subsamples of $gg$ and $q\bar{q}$ events, allowing for tests of
discrimination of hadronic $W$ bosons, quarks, and gluons.

Individual $gg$ and $q\bar{q}$ samples were produced at leading order (LO)
using \textsc{MadGraph5} \cite{Alwall:2011uj}, while $W^+W^-$ samples were generated using
the \textsc{JHU Generator} \cite{Gao:2010qx,Bolognesi:2012mm,Anderson:2013afp} to allow for separation of longitudinal and
transverse polarizations. Both were generated using \textsc{CTEQ6L1}
PDFs \cite{Pumplin:2002vw}. The samples were produced in exclusive $p_T$ bins
of width 100 {\GeV}, with the slicing parameter
chosen to be the $p_T$ of any final state parton or $W$ at LO. At the
parton-level the \pt bins investigated were 300-400 GeV, 500-600 GeV
and 1.0-1.1 TeV. 
%Since
%no matching was performed, a cut on any parton was equivalent. 
The samples were
then all showered through \textsc{Pythia8} (version 8.176) \cite{Sjostrand:2007gs} using the default tune 4C \cite{Buckley:2011ms}.
For each of the various samples (W,q,g) and $p_T$ bins, 500,000 events were simulated.

\subsection{Top tagging} \label{sec:top-samples}
Samples were generated at $\sqrt{s}=14\TeV$. Standard Model dijet and top pair
samples were produced with \textsc{Sherpa} 2.0.0 \cite{Gleisberg:2008ta,Schumann:2007mg,Krauss:2001iv,Gleisberg:2008fv,Hoeche:2009rj,Schonherr:2008av}, with matrix elements of up
to two extra partons matched to the shower. The top samples  included only
hadronic decays and  were generated in exclusive $\pt$ bins of width 100 \GeV,
taking as slicing parameter the maximum of the top/anti-top $\pt$. The QCD samples 
 were generated with a cut on the leading parton-level jet $\pt$, where
parton-level jets are clustered with the anti-$k_t$ algorithm and jet radii of
$R= 0.4,\,0.8,\,1.2$. The matching scale is selected to be $Q_{\rm cut}=40, 60, 80 \GeV$ for
the $p_{T\,\text{min}}=600, 1000$, and $1500 \GeV$ bins, respectively. For the top samples, 100k 
events were generated in each bin, while 200k QCD events were generated in each bin.
