\subsection{Quark/gluon and $W$ taggging}

Samples were generated the $\sqrt{s} = 8\TeV$ for QCD dijets and $W^+W^-$
pairs decaying hadronically off a \\
(pseudo)scalar resonance. The QCD events
were split into subsamples of $gg$ and $q\bar{q}$ events, allowing for tests
of both $W$ and quark-gluon discrimination. 

For events at $\sqrt{s} = 8\TeV$, individual quark and gluon samples were
produced at leading order (LO) using \textsc{MadGraph5}, while $W^+W^-$ samples
were generated using the \textsc{JHU Generator} to allow for separation
of longitudinal and transverse polarizations. Both were produced in $p_T$
bins of 100 \TeV. and generated using \textsc{CTEQ6L1} PDFs. These were
then showered using \textsc{Pythia8} (version 8.176) using the default tune 4C.

The analysis relies on clustering with \textsc{FastJet} 3.03. Events were
clustered using the anti-$k_t$ algorithm with jet radii of $R = 0.4, 0.8, 1.2$.
A cut on the jet $\pt$ is once again applied after showering/clustering, to ensure
similar $\pt$ spectra for signal and background in each bin.

\subsection{Top tagging}
Samples were generated at $\sqrt{s}=14\TeV$. Standard Model dijet and top pair samples were produced
with \textsc{Sherpa} 2.0.0, with matrix elements with up to two extra partons matched
to the shower. The top samples included only hadronic decays and
 were generated in exclusive $\pt$ bins of width 100 GeV, taking as slicing parameter the
 maximum of the top/anti-top $\pt$. The QCD samples were generated with a cut on the leading
 parton-level jet $\pt$, where parton-level jets are clustered with the anti-$k_t$ algorithm with jet radius
 $R=1.2$. The matching scale is selected to be $Q_{\rm cut}=40$, 60, 80 GeV for the $p_{T\,\mathrm{min}}=600$, 1000, and 1500 GeV bins, respectively.
 
 The analysis relies on  \textsc{FastJet} 3.0.3 for jet clustering and calculation of jet substructure observables. Events were clustered using the anti-$k_t$ algorithm with jet radii of $R=0.4$, 0.8, and 1.2. A cut on the jet $\pt$ is once again applied after showering/clustering, to ensure
similar $\pt$ spectra for signal and background in each bin.
