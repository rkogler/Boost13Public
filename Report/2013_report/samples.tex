Samples were generaated the $\sqrt{s} = 8\TeV$ for QCD dijets and $W^+W-$
pairs decaying hadronically off a (psuedo)scalar resonance. The QCD events
were split into subsamples of $gg$ and $q\bar{q}$ events, allowing for tests
of both $W$ and quark-gluon discrimination. Top tagging was studies at
$\sqrt{s} = 14\TeV$ by... 

For events at $\sqrt{s} = 8\TeV$, individual quark and gluon samples were
produced at leading order (LO) using \textsc{MadGraph5}, while $W^+W^-$ samples
were generated using the \textsc{JHU Generator} to allow for separation
of longitudinal and transverse polarizations. Both were produced in $p_T$
bins of 100 \TeV. and generated using \textsc{CTEQ6L1} PDFs. These were
then showered using \textsc{Pythia8} (version 8.176) using the default tune 4C.

The analysis relies on clustering with \textsc{FastJet} 3.03, and,
for 14 \TeV events, the \textsc{Rivet} analysis framework. Events were
clusterd using the anti-$k_t$ algorithm, using jet radii of $R = 0.4, 0.8, 1.2$.
